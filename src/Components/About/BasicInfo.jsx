        I am filled with memories of my hometown in Khustia, Bangladesh. I was
        born on October 8, 1993, and grew up in a close-knit family of three,
        including my parents, & sister. In September 2021, I got married and
        added a new chapter to my life story. I completed my studies in
        Chittagong and now reside in Dhaka for professional purposes. Despite
        being far from my hometown, I always carry with me the love and values
        that were instilled in me during my upbringing in Khustia.

        Continuing my early life story, I received my education in Bangladesh.
        In 2009, I completed my school education at Housing & Settlement Public
        School. I then went on to complete my college education at BEPZA Public
        School & College. I am proud to say that I am a graduate of the
        University of Science and Technology Chittagong, where I studied
        Computer Science & Engineering. This education provided me with the
        foundation and skills necessary to pursue my professional goals.

        I began my career as a support engineer at Antaranga Dot Com Limited in
        the end of 2018. I worked hard and was eventually promoted to a Network
        Operation Center Engineer in 2020.In 2021, I decided to change my career
        path and moved from being a network engineer to a front-end developer. I
        was hired by Techhack Canada as a front-end developer for a startup
        project. After successfully completing that project, I joined BYSL in
        2022 as a UI/UX Designer & Developer. I am proud of my professional
        journey and the opportunities I have had to grow and develop in my
        career. I am always seeking new challenges and ways to enhance my skills
        and knowledge in the field.
